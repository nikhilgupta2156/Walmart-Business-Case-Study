<h2>📦 WALMART BUSINESS CASE STUDY | CONFIDENCE INTERVALS & CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM</h2>

<p>
  I had the opportunity to work on a Walmart business case study where I applied <strong>Confidence Intervals</strong> and the <strong>Central Limit Theorem (CLT)</strong> to help understand and forecast sales metrics for better decision-making.
</p>

<h3>🎯 Objective:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To estimate the true average weekly sales of Walmart outlets with statistical confidence</li>
  <li>To apply CLT and understand how sample size affects the estimation of population parameters</li>
</ul>

<h3>🔍 What I Did:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Explored the distribution of <strong>weekly sales data</strong> across different departments and stores</li>
  <li>Calculated <strong>confidence intervals</strong> using sample means and standard error</li>
  <li>Simulated <strong>CLT behavior</strong> using repeated sampling at various sizes (n = 30, 50, 100, 1000)</li>
  <li>Visualized how the <strong>sampling distribution approaches normality</strong> as sample size increases</li>
  <li>Provided statistical interpretations of upper and lower bounds of average weekly sales</li>
</ul>

<h3>📈 Key Learning:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This case strengthened my understanding of inferential statistics and showed how <strong>sample-based estimates can guide large-scale business decisions</strong></li>
  <li>The CLT simulations clearly demonstrated how larger sample sizes reduce variability and improve reliability</li>
</ul>

<h3>🛠 Tools & Skills Used:</h3>
<p>
  Python | NumPy | Pandas | Seaborn | Matplotlib | Confidence Interval | CLT | Sampling | Data Visualization | Business Analytics
</p>

<h4>💡 Business Takeaway:</h4>
<p>
  Walmart can use these insights to <strong>plan inventory, allocate marketing budgets, and forecast sales performance</strong> more accurately across stores—especially when full population data is unavailable.
